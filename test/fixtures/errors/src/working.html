<p>Here is some correctly spelled text.</p>

<p>My name is Geoffrey Challen, which your dictionary might not know. It's
challenging.</p>

<p>Most dictionaries still don't think that smartphone is a word.</p>

<p>This wrd is intentionally misspelled.</p>

<p>Contractions like you'll and I'll can be tough, particularly to match with
exceptions; also smartphone's.</p>

<p>This <span class="spelling_exception">aoeu</span> is also intentionally
misspelled.</p>

<p>Let's test some&nbsp;non-breaking space. And the end of a sentence with
smartphone. And a colon, smartphone: the future. And back to back, smartphone
smartphone.</p>
